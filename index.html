                        Dear Health and Wellness Seeker, 

Hi, I'm George Stavrou.

And I want to get one thing straight, right from the get-go:

I don't want you to continue living with low energy and poor self-esteem due to the shape that you are currently in.

What I really want is for you to have high energy and feel good about the new and improved version of yourself just waiting to conquer the world!

We've never met. I know nothing about you, yet I'm going out on a limb to make the following prediction (hopefully, without you taking any offense):

	You may very well be frustrated with your current shape and fitness levels, 
	You've decided you're ready to make 2013 THE YEAR that you get into the best shape of your life but you simply don't know how!
	And not only that, but with so much information out there especially on the internet, that you are totally confused!
	You have no idea about how to approach the topic of nutrition - which is extremely important for your weight control efforts.
	and the list goes on.
There are a number of so-called 'experts' giving conflicting advice on nutrition and all the rest of these issues. While their approach DOES work for SOME people - it doesn't work for everyone all the time. In fact, following the WRONG nutrition and health and fitness program for YOUR particular needs can actually leave you feeling sick and in worse shape!

          <h2 class=" m-3 text-center">Are You A Victim Of One Of These Following 'Fitness Myths'?</h2>

          <small class="p-3">Have you asked yourself some or all of these questions but didn't know how to answer them? 
            Not many people DO know how - not even your doctor! And this is just the beginning of the list for getting in shape!</small>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-justified">
              <h3>Now you may be wondering why you should even listen to me</h3>
          <p >I empathize with your situation. Controlling your weight and getting fit is not an easy process and there is so much conflicting 
            advice out there it's almost impossible to know who to believe. I have tried a number 
            of different diets and training programs over the years with varying degrees of success but none of them lived up to their word.
          Let's be honest! If losing fat were easy then you would not be reading this in the first place.
          I began training as a teenager (15) over 25 years ago. I had low energy, got sick fairly often, and felt bad about my appearance. 
          No matter what I tried, I could not get the results I wanted.
          
          Sure, I did make some progress from the programs I used, but there was a lot of wasted effort. I would spend up to two hours in the 
          gym working my butt off while following the latest fad diet. Little did I know <strong> was over-training </strong>by following the 
          exercise programs featured in the latest fitness magazine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
              
              <div class="  ">

                <h3 class="pull-left"> Actually, the diets I was on contributed to my health problems.</h3>
                <p > But fast forward to today. Do I have ALL the answers that you are looking for? Of course not. No individual does AND don't believe the ones that say they do!
                  
                  But after 25+ years of my own research and testing with proven results and consulting with experts in the health and fitness industry, I finally cracked the code. I unlocked the secrets keys to losing fat, increasing one's energy and improving their health and wellness.

These people learned what they know from reading - not by actually doing anything with clients in the real world.

              Myths/misconceptions like
              
                Machines are ALWAYS safer to use than free weights
                You should NEVER bend your knees past 90 degrees when you squat, because it's bad for your knees
                Jogging/Running on a treadmill is the same as doing it outdoors
                And many more where they came from!

                   You may be asking yourself 'how can I work with what I have to be the new and improved version of me instead of trying to look like the 'doctored photos' on the magazine covers?'

                  Because of my experience, I can show you precisely what you can do about it  starting right away!

                  I want to share with you on a daily basis how to <u>create the health and fitness levels</u> of our choosing.

                  And THAT is precisely what this exciting new package shows you in easy-to-understand, simple-to-use, no-nonsense, bull-free fashion.

                  I know that you are sick of sorting through the thousands of health and fitness websites (that often have conflicting advice) -  and that you just want to understand the basic principles on fitness and weight control...to know what works, and how to make it work for you.
